# Gravity Forms Fluent CRM Feed Plugin

This plugin adds a Gravity Forms Feed that lets you: 

- Add contact to FluentCRM from GravityForms
- Map submission data into a Fluent CRM Subscriber as a:
    - Form Submission
    - Donation
    - Purchase History (coming soon)

We actually copy some baseline data to Fluent CRM Subscriber meta so it will always stay with them regardless of status of Gravity Forms entry (it will still be there if the entry gets deleted). Convenient links to the entry in GF are there as well.

## Motivation Behind the Plugin
I wanted to extend tools that I already use without adding extra website bloat and duplicative database tables. This plugin aims to extend FluentCRM into a full-blown donor platform as well as maintaining its exisiting functionality as a CRM.

### Release Notes
#### v0.1.0 
Initial release. I'm sure there are tons of bugs. We don't do much checking for plugins to be there, etc. So it's a bit fragile at the moment!
